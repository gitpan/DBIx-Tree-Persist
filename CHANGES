Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Tree::Persist.

1.01  Thu Oct  7 10:09:00 2010
	  - Add dbh as an optional parameter to new(). If not supplied, use the config file to get
	  	DBI connect options. This makes testing easier, too. Document new parameter.
	  - Add option data_structure to output a structure which can be turned into JSON.
	  	This uses the new method build_structure().
	  - Make pretty-printing the tree a stand-alone method: pretty_print().
	  - Add Tree::DAG_Node::Persist to See Also.
	  - Add README file.
	  - Patch usage of File::Temp in t/test.t for BSD-based systems (EXLOCK => 0). This is part of
	  	making the code look much more like t/test.t as shipped with Test::DAG_Node::Persist.
	  - Adopt DBIx::Admin::CreateTable for t/test.t.

1.00  Tue Sep 21  9:14:00 2010
